                <p>Gem Valley is one of the northernmost valleys along the Wasatch Range. It is accessed primarily by Idaho State Highway 34 from the south, and U.S. Route 30 from the east and west. Most of the valley is in Caribou County, and portions extend into Franklin County to the south, and Bannock County to the north. The Bear River runs through the valley as well as several small streams.
                Grace and Bancroft are the only incorporated towns in Gem Valley. However, there are several unincorporated communities including Cleveland, Thatcher, Lago, Bench, Niter, Dugway, Turner, Stanley, Lund, Tenmile, and Chesterfield. Some of these were once pioneer-era towns and settlements, but the name now denotes a region of the valley, rather than a town with defined boundaries.

                <p>The Gem Valley has economic growth of this area by encouraging families and small businesses to move to the valley. The Gem Valley has traditionally been a "Bedroom Community" with many wage earners commuting the to Soda Springs to work at the heavy industry sites.  However, the number of job opportunities in valley are increasing.  We now have our own small business industrial park that is home to Heritage Safe Company, a major manufacture of gun safes.  It is also the home of Biotech Nutrients, the manufacture of an excellent fertilizer.  A new subdivision offering 22 building lots with paved streets, city sewer and water and underground utilities has been developed with room for future expansion.

                <p>Although a small community, the Gem Valley offers an array of activities that most can enjoy. Hunting and fishing are popular among many residents of Grace, as are motorsports. There are several local canyons that are accessible during the summer by truck or ATV, and in the winter by snowmobile. The nearby Alexander Reservoir provides summertime water recreation such as boating and swimming. The local Niter Ice Cave is accessible year-round and even beginning spelunkers have little trouble exploring the cave. Grace is also home to the Caribou County Fair and Rodeo.

                <p>Perhaps the one crop that Gem Valley is most famous for is their certified seed potatoes.  Each fall, during harvest time, tourists from all over the nation flock to this area to purchase their winters supply of these delicious potatoes.  With its rich volcanic soil, warm summer days with cool evenings, and an abundant supply of water, this valley is an ideal place for raising potatoes.  The other major crops grown in Gem Valley are alfalfa (hay), and grain.

                <p>Each year, in the Gem Valley, Grace hosts the Caribou County Fair and Rodeo the first week of August. A carnival comes each year at fair time and it keeps everyone happy with thrilling rides and games of chance.  In addition, food booths, sponsored by local organizations, are busy all week feeding the hungry fair goers. The exhibit halls are filled with prize winning crafts, arts, foods, animals and business booths.  Area artists and photographers submit their best works as they compete for the blue ribbons.  Exhibitors may enter items in either 4-H or Open Class competition.  Animals exhibited in 4-H are kept on the grounds, groomed, fed and put through their paces, with a Livestock Sale held after the judging.  On Friday and Saturday of each fair week, a PRCA sanctioned rodeo is held. Other events include team roping, team penning, and branding.  A Fun Run or Walk and Horseshoe pitching contest are also offered to anyone wanting to participate.  The annual fair and rodeo also includes some terrific musical shows.
