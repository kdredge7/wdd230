        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3><em>We are the Larsens. We are the proud owners of  Bountiful Foods.</em></h3>
        <p>Our story started long ago from strong family roots in farming. Over time, our family farms were sold and time moved on.
            But we never forgot our roots; we had a calling to the land and our hearts desired to farm. We both wanted a connection to our food and the land it was raised on. We decided to take the leap and start small to grow the food we love.
            <br><br>We have created our own story and paved our own way to offer organic and fresh produce. As we continue to build Bountiful Foods from the ground up, we find great joy as stewards of this land while sharing nutritious food to families near and far.
            <br><br>We hope to someday have a homestead that we can pass down to our children, but until then we cherish the opportunity that our family has given us to work with the land.
            <br><br>Our story is still unfolding and the future of Bountiful Foods begins with each new day. We are farming together as a family while passing down beliefs and values to the next generation. Thanks for your support and appreciating REAL food.

        <h2>About Organic Farming</h2>
        <h3><em>We are steadfast in keeping our farming practices true to our vision for a better food system.</em></h3>
        <p>Crops are organic when they are grown on a piece of land without any non-organic material applied to the land for the past three years. Each year, a certified organic farm is inspected by a third-party certifier who walks fields, reviews receipts and inspects existing inventory and other records to verify that an organic farm is only using materials permitted by the National Organic Program’s standards.
            <br><br>In general, if an item can be found in nature, it can often be considered organic. If the item has been chemically altered from the form in which it was found in nature, it is likely prohibited for use in organic agriculture.
            <br><br>We care about reducing food miles, connecting with our customers, providing a healthy work environment, promoting biodiversity and growing varieties of crops that tasted better while operating an environmentally and economically sustainable farming system. Today’s organic standard does not certify for these items, but we are steadfast in keeping our farming practices true to our vision for a better food system.
